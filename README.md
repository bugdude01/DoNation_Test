# DoNation_Test

# The Do Nation platform allows individuals to pledge to do an action to improve their lives and
make an environmental impact. Each action in our system is capable of supporting multiple
metrics, for example, CO2, water and waste. When a user pledges to do an action, they answer a
few questions which generate the savings expected if they do as promised. An example is shown
below:

## image missing but is an online form asking you to select options from lists or input data manually

#Hereâ€™s a few examples, with made up data. Please note that the calculations will change over time
so the system needs to keep check of what version a user pledges towards:

# there are a number of data points acting as conversion factors that relate to currrent energy supplier, water
content within mead based meald versus veggie meals as well as number of people in a household utilising a particular
heating source (gas and oil vs electricity) with either a bog standard supplier vs a new green supplier.

# Tasks
Please write tests as you see fit while doing the below:
1) Setup a basic Django project
2) Create a system to store this information and details about what pledge a user has made
3) Create a homepage that shows the total number of pledges and the impact of each metric
(CO2, water, waste)
4) Create a view that shows what pledges a user has made. You should be able to view what
pledges another user has made
